I am proficient with R and have experience with C, Rust, and Python. In addition I also have experience using SQL through the R and Python languages and limited familiarity in SAS. In Python I have used the numpy, pandas, seaborn, basemap, sqlite3, and matplotlib packages to visualize and analyze data from a variety of sources. I have worked for two years in operations in guest services for the UC Davis Bookstore, with one duty being the providing of insight with regards to purchasing trends in the store in an effort to improve sales. My goal is to reach proficiency and eventual mastery of stastistcal computing packages through extensive experience in an effort to attain a data analyst position. My interests stem from a intrigue in the identification and visualization of trends within data sets to answer a wide range of questions. In particular, I am interested in data that relate to the following:

* Development of Technology

## Statistical Projects


[UFOs and Disasters Project](https://eabell94.github.io/EAB%2BSecond%2BAnalysis.html)

<b>Description:</b> The objective was to answer a series of questions regarding a UFO sightings data set and a natural disasters data set, both focused on the United States. My portion of questions focused on identifying the most reported UFO sightings and top disasters; and potential correlations between state counties that had either the most reported disasters; the most reported UFO sightings; or the county with the longest declared disaster.
